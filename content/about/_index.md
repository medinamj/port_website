Matthew is a gay Xicano artist from Northern New Mexico, born and raised. Professionally, he worked as a microbiologist throughout his academic career where his research revolved around microbial mat ecology and microbial genomics. After dropping out of his PhD program, Matthew moved back the U.S. Southwest where he learned how to weave and stitch colcha embroidery. Matthew is a 4th generation weaver and is currently working in Espa√±ola, New Mexico. 

Artist's Statement:

Currently my work is heavily influenced by home space and background. I want to explore using a Spanish colonial art form (colcha embroidery) to decolonize stories and reveal the hidden histories in both queer and Xicanx cultures. 

Education:

* M.S. Earth and Enviornmental Science/Geomicrobiology | University of Michigan, 2017
* B.S. Biology | University of New Mexico, 2014
