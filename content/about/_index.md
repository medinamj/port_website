Matthew is a gay Xicano artist from Northern New Mexico. Professionally, he worked as a microbiologist throughout his academic career where his research revolved around microbial mat ecology and microbial genomics. After dropping out of his PhD program, Matthew moved back the U.S. Southwest where he learned how to weave and stitch colcha embroidery. Matthew is a 4th generation weaver and is currently working in Espa√±ola, New Mexico. 

**Artist's Statement:**\
My work is influenced by where and how I grew up. I want to explore using a Spanish colonial art form (colcha embroidery) to decolonize stories and reveal hidden histories of queer and Xicanx folk. 

**Education:**\
M.S. Geomicrobiology; University of Michigan, 2017\
B.S. Biology; University of New Mexico, 2014
