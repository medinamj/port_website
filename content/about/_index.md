Matthew is a Northern New Mexican, born and raised. He is also a self-professed rural gay. Professionally, he worked as a microbiologist throughout his academic career where his research revolved around microbe-mineral interactions, microbial mat ecology, and microbial ‘omics. After dropping out of his PhD program, Matthew moved back the U.S. Southwest where he learned how to weave, and stitch colcha embroidery. Matthew is a 4th generation weaver and is currently working in Española, New Mexico.

##### Artist's Statement:

Currently my work is heavily influenced by place and background—that is, my home/the U.S. Southwest/and agriculture. I am also inspired by traditional Chimayo and Rio Grande Style rugs. 

My artwork is a reclamation of culture that has been endangered since the American Imperial Colonialism of the U.S. Southwest. And I want to be able to use a Spanish colonial art form (colcha embroidery) to decolonize stories and reveal the hidden histories of queer and mestizo folk. 

Lastly, I see some of my artwork as an act of ancient rebellion because I make shatnez. Shatnez, as mentioned in Jewish and Christian texts, is the conjoining of linen and wool through weaving or stitching and it is prohibited. Specifically in the Christian bible, wearing shatnez is prohibited. Today, breaking this biblical law is widely considered to be no big deal. But I find my making of shatnez fitting considering my biblically disgraced homosexuality.
