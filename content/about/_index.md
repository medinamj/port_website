##### Artist's Statement:

Currently my work is heavily influenced by place and background—that is, my home/the U.S. Southwest/and agriculture. I am also inspired by traditional Chimayo and Rio Grande Style rugs. I want to explore using a Spanish colonial art form (colcha embroidery) to decolonize stories and reveal the hidden histories of queer and mestizo folk.
